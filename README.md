# Interactive Map of Fast-Charging Policy Simulation

This repository hosts an interactive Leaflet map that visualizes the spatial redistribution of DC fast-charging demand in Beijing under different pricing policies. Each bubble represents a public fast-charging station, with bubble size and color reflecting its simulated station-choice probability under the selected policy scenario.
